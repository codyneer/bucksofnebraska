    content: `Nebraska is home to over 250 Wildlife Management Areas and more than 1.2 million acres of publicly accessible land. Best of all, access to WMAs is free — no entry permit required. Whether you're chasing whitetails in the river bottoms or flushing roosters in the CRP, there's a spot for you. Here are five of our favorites.

## 1. Clear Creek WMA — Keith County

Spanning over 3,200 acres near Lake McConaughy, Clear Creek is one of the largest and most diverse WMAs in the state. The mix of riparian woodlands, wetlands, river channel, and upland grasslands makes it a destination for whitetail, mule deer, turkey, pheasant, and dove. The sheer size means you can get away from other hunters — work the timber edges along the creek bottoms for late-season whitetails, or push the grasslands for roosters.

## 2. Rock Glen WMA — Jefferson County

Located about six miles east and two miles south of Fairbury in southeast Nebraska, Rock Glen covers 707 acres of virgin and restored prairie mixed with wood-studded ravines. The terrain is rolling and varied, with thick timber draws that hold whitetails year-round. The area is also managed with food plots, making it a solid option for archery hunters willing to hang a portable stand. Turkey numbers are strong here too, especially in the spring.

## 3. Flathead WMA — Jefferson County

Just one mile south of Fairbury along the Little Blue River, Flathead's 250 acres of heavily wooded bottomland is a sleeper spot. The thick timber and river corridor funnel deer movement, and the proximity to agricultural fields means there's always food nearby. It's small enough that most hunters overlook it — which is exactly why it can produce. Primitive camping is allowed, so you can set up the night before and be in your stand at first light.

## 4. Bordeaux Creek WMA — Dawes County

One of the newest additions to the WMA system, Bordeaux Creek covers 1,915 acres just east of Chadron on Highway 20 in the Pine Ridge. This is big, rugged country — ponderosa pine ridges, deep creek draws, and open meadows. Whitetail and mule deer share the habitat here, and the area holds solid turkey populations. The Pine Ridge is one of Nebraska's most scenic hunting destinations, and Bordeaux Creek gives you public access right in the heart of it.

## 5. Valentine National Wildlife Refuge & McKelvie National Forest — Cherry County

The Valentine area in the central Sandhills is a public land paradise. Between the Valentine National Wildlife Refuge, McKelvie National Forest, and Fort Niobrara, there are over 200,000 acres of public land to explore. The Sandhills produce some of Nebraska's biggest whitetails — the rolling grass-covered dunes, cedar-lined valleys, and scattered wetlands create ideal habitat. Mule deer are common here too, and the upland bird hunting for sharptail grouse and prairie chickens is some of the best in the country.

## Pro Tips for Nebraska Public Land

Before you go, download the Nebraska Game and Parks Public Access Atlas — it consolidates every WMA, national forest, and privately enrolled Open Fields and Waters parcel onto one interactive map. Plan your access routes ahead of time, and remember: portable tree stands can only be used on WMAs between August 15 and January 31. Most importantly, get off the beaten path. Nebraska's public land gets a fraction of the pressure that neighboring states see, and there are big deer out there waiting for hunters willing to put in the work.`,

    content: `Late-season deer hunting in Nebraska means December and January sits where daytime highs hover in the mid-20s to low 30s, and wind chills regularly dip below zero. If you're sitting in a treestand for three or four hours without moving, your layering system is the difference between a successful hunt and an early tap-out. Here's how to build a system that actually works.

## The Three-Layer Principle

Every effective cold-weather system follows three rules: wick moisture away from skin, trap body heat in insulating layers, and block wind and precipitation on the outside. Get one of those wrong and the whole system fails.

## Base Layer: The Foundation

Your base layer sits against your skin and has one job — move sweat away from your body. Even in bitter cold, your body produces moisture, and wet skin loses heat 25 times faster than dry skin.

**Merino wool** is the gold standard for treestand hunters. It wicks moisture efficiently, retains warmth even when damp, and is naturally antimicrobial — meaning it won't stink after multiple sits. A 200-weight merino top and bottom is the sweet spot for Nebraska late season.

**Polyester synthetics** wick faster and dry quicker, making them better for walk-in hunts where you'll sweat on the approach. They're also less expensive. The trade-off: synthetics hold odor, even with anti-microbial treatments. For all-day treestand sits, merino wins.

## Mid Layer: The Insulator

This is where you trap dead air to retain body heat. You'll want at least two mid layers in sub-zero conditions:

**Layer one:** A midweight fleece or merino wool sweater (200-300 weight). This stays on all day regardless of activity level.

**Layer two:** A puffy insulated jacket — synthetic fill like PrimaLoft works well because it retains insulation even when compressed against a tree. Down is warmer pound-for-pound but loses its loft if it gets wet. In Nebraska's dry winters, down is a viable option, but synthetic is more forgiving.

## Outer Layer: The Shield

Your outer layer blocks wind, rain, and snow while letting interior moisture escape. Look for a jacket and pant system that's windproof and water-resistant with some breathability. You don't need a full waterproof rain suit for treestand hunting — that much waterproofing traps too much moisture.

A softshell with a DWR coating handles most Nebraska late-season conditions. If wet snow or freezing rain is in the forecast, upgrade to a hardshell.

## Extremities: Where Hunts End Early

Your core might be warm, but if your hands and feet are numb, you're climbing down.

**Feet:** Wear a thin merino liner sock under a heavyweight wool hunting sock. Place adhesive toe warmers between the two layers. A key trick: bring a closed-cell foam pad and stand on it in the treestand — it insulates your feet from the cold metal platform, which makes a massive difference.

**Hands:** Wear thin merino gloves for shooting and keep your hands in an insulated hand muff with hand warmers between shots. Heavyweight gloves for the walk in, thin gloves in the stand.

**Head and neck:** A balaclava or neck gaiter plus a insulated beanie covers most of your heat loss. Up to 40% of body heat escapes through your head and neck.

## The Walk-In Rule

The biggest mistake hunters make: overdressing for the walk in, arriving at the stand soaked in sweat, then freezing within an hour. Dress so you're slightly cold during the walk. Carry your insulating mid layer and outer layer in a pack and add them once you're settled in the stand. Arrive dry, stay warm.

When the temperature drops below zero with wind chill, the risks of hypothermia and frostbite are real. Know your limits, pack extra layers, and hunt smart.`,

    content: `Ask a whitetail hunter to name the top five deer states and you'll hear Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Wisconsin, maybe Ohio. Rarely Nebraska. That's starting to change — but slowly. And honestly? Most Nebraska hunters are fine keeping it quiet. Here's why the Good Life state is one of the best-kept secrets in deer hunting.

## Over-the-Counter Tags

While states like Iowa require a lottery draw that can take years to pull, Nebraska sells whitetail buck permits over the counter. The statewide archery permit is available to residents and non-residents alike. Nebraska also offers one of the longest archery seasons in the country, running from September 1 through December 31 in most units. That's four months of bow season.

For firearm hunters, the November rifle season offers additional opportunity, and the state also has a late muzzleloader season that runs into December and January depending on the unit.

## 1.2 Million Acres of Public Land

Nebraska's Game and Parks Commission manages over 250 Wildlife Management Areas, and when you add in national forests, national grasslands, and the Open Fields and Waters program on private land, there are over 1.2 million acres of publicly accessible hunting land. WMAs are free to access — no special entry permits required.

The Sandhills region alone — the largest grass-stabilized dune system in the Western Hemisphere — offers hundreds of thousands of acres of public ground that sees minimal hunting pressure.

## Deer in Every County

White-tailed deer are found statewide, with the highest densities in the eastern third of the state and along major river corridors — the Missouri, Platte, Elkhorn, and Niobrara. Mule deer occupy the western two-thirds and are the dominant species in about 20 counties. Plenty of units offer opportunities to harvest both species in the same season.

The state has historically produced impressive animals. Nebraska's eastern river bottoms are considered sleepers for trophy-class whitetails — the combination of agricultural food sources, timber corridors, and relatively low hunting pressure creates conditions for bucks to reach maturity.

## Low Pressure Compared to Neighbors

This is the real secret. Nebraska's human population is 1.97 million, and it's the 7th least densely populated state. Compare that to Iowa (3.2 million), Illinois (12.5 million), or Ohio (11.8 million). Fewer hunters means less pressure on deer herds, and on public land especially, you'll find elbow room that simply doesn't exist in the Midwest's more famous deer states.

Even during the November firearms season, many WMAs in central and western Nebraska see only a handful of hunters. You can hunt entire weekends without encountering another orange vest.

## Recent Challenges — And Conservation

It's worth noting that Nebraska's deer herd has faced challenges in recent years. Drought and Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD) have impacted populations, particularly in some western units. The Game and Parks Commission has responded with management changes — reducing antlerless permits, shrinking some unit boundaries, and cutting firearm permit quotas by 800 combined in several units for 2025.

These conservation measures are a sign that the state takes management seriously. Deer populations are cyclical, and Nebraska's diverse habitat base gives the herd strong recovery potential.

## The Bottom Line

Nebraska offers what most whitetail hunters dream about: over-the-counter tags, millions of acres of public land, trophy potential, and room to hunt without crowds. The state may never get the magazine-cover attention of Iowa or Illinois — and plenty of Nebraska hunters prefer it that way. If you've been looking for your next out-of-state hunt, put Nebraska on the short list. You won't be disappointed.`,

    content: `Trail cameras are the single best scouting tool a whitetail hunter can own. But a camera in the wrong spot — or checked too often — does more harm than good. Here's how to get the most intel with the least intrusion.

## Height and Angle Matter

The standard advice is to mount your camera 3 to 4 feet off the ground, angled slightly downward. That works for food plots and open areas. But on trails and funnels where deer pass within a few feet of the camera, that height puts the unit right in their face — and mature bucks will notice.

For tighter setups, mount the camera 6 to 8 feet high and angle it down toward the trail. This keeps it out of a deer's direct line of sight and reduces the chance of a buck catching the infrared flash or hearing the trigger. A ratchet strap and a small wedge or stick behind the camera gets the angle right.

## Face North or South

This is one of the most overlooked tips. A camera facing east catches direct morning sun. A camera facing west gets blasted by evening sun. Both result in washed-out images, false triggers from sun glare, and batteries drained by thousands of blank photos.

Mount your cameras facing north or south whenever possible. You'll get cleaner images and far fewer false triggers.

## Placement Strategy by Season

**Spring and Summer (April - August):** Focus on food sources. Place cameras on field edges where deer enter to feed in the evening — mineral sites, food plots, and the corners of ag fields where trails converge. This is your inventory period. You're cataloging what bucks are in the area and watching antler development.

**Early Fall (September - October):** Shift cameras to transition corridors — the routes deer use between bedding and feeding areas. Inside corners of timber, saddles in ridgelines, and creek crossings are money spots. Hang cameras at trail intersections where multiple paths converge.

**Rut (November):** Move cameras to scrapes and licking branches. Bucks will work scrape lines relentlessly during pre-rut and peak rut. A camera on a community scrape in a funnel or pinch point can capture every mature buck in the area within a two-week window.

**Late Season (December - January):** Food is king again. Put cameras back on food sources — standing corn, beans, or winter food plots. Deer are burning calories to survive and will pattern heavily to the best available food.

## Trail Intersections: The Best Single Location

If you can only hang one camera, put it at a trail intersection. Find a main trail running along a ridge or creek bottom with secondary trails feeding in from the sides. A camera at the junction captures deer moving in multiple directions and gives you a complete picture of how the area is used.

## When to Check Cameras

This is where most hunters blow it. Every time you walk to a camera, you leave scent, create noise, and alert deer to human presence. The less you check, the better your data.

**Standard cameras:** Check every two to four weeks, minimum. Plan your route in and out just like you would a hunt — rubber boots, scent-free clothing, and a route that avoids bedding areas.

**Cellular cameras:** These are a game changer. Photos transmit to your phone in real time, so you never have to visit the camera except to swap batteries or SD cards. The upfront cost is higher, but the reduction in pressure is worth every dollar. If you're serious about hunting mature bucks on a specific property, cell cams are the move.

## Camera Settings

Set your camera to take a 3-photo burst with a 30-second delay between triggers. This gives you enough images to see the full animal (and what's behind it) without filling your card with 10,000 photos of the same doe. Time-lapse mode on food plots — one photo every 5 minutes during the last two hours of daylight — is another excellent strategy for patterning evening feeding activity.

The goal is always the same: maximum intel, minimum intrusion. Let the cameras do the scouting so you don't have to.`,
